I often struggle to find pleasant colours to use for plots in R. In the 10 years I've been using R, I've surely wasted days or weeks trying to find palettes with sufficient contrast, colourblind-friendliness and - the bit I really struggle with - aesthetically pleasing. Often I've checked the first two only to have people say things like "ouch" when I show them a particularly lively plot.

So I was pleased when Cefas issued their communications handbook, and included a lovely set of palettes, complete with HEX codes so I could just use them instead. I recently used this to produce the bar charts in the Gender Pay Gap Report, and on the whole, I'm really pleased with how they turned out.

I thought it might save some people - particularly the R User Group - some time if they were written up with a couple of examples. So here they are. 
~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~
```R
cefas_tones=
cefas_cols=
cefas_shades1=
cefas_shades2=
```
